# Copilot Workspace Instructions

Use skills from `.github/skills/` for all LikeC4 tasks. Skills are automatically applied based on user requests.

**MCP servers:**
- **LikeC4 MCP** (REQUIRED before changes): Use `read-project-summary` to load context, `search-element` to find elements, `find-relationships` to check connections, `open-view` to preview diagrams
- **Context7 MCP** (as needed): Query `/likec4/likec4` library docs when uncertain about syntax or features

**Workflow:** Always start with `understand-project-structure` skill when beginning work on a project.
