# Copilot Workspace Instructions

Use skills from `.github/skills/` for all LikeC4 tasks. Skills are automatically applied based on user requests.

**MCP servers:**
- **LikeC4 MCP** (REQUIRED before changes): Use `read-project-summary` to load context, `search-element` to find elements, `find-relationships` to check connections, `open-view` to preview diagrams
- **Context7 MCP** (as needed): Query `/likec4/likec4` library docs when uncertain about syntax or features

**Workflow:** Always start with `understand-project-structure` skill when beginning work on a project.

**Documentation Updates:** After making any change to the codebase or workspace (model files, configurations, architecture), look for documentation in root workspace folder, and update it to reflect the changes. Ensure tutorials, guides, references, and explanations remain accurate and synchronized with the current state of the project.
